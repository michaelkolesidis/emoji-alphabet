**Welcome to the Emoji Alphabet!**

The Emoji Alphabet is an effort to create a standardized system where each letter of the Latin alphabet is represented by a unique emoji. An important aspect of our approach is the inclusion of a character for the space, which makes reading easier. The project also extends to include punctuation, numbers, and mathematical symbols, providing a complete emoji-based representation system.

To make things easier, we offer a tool that allows you to transliterate your text into this Emoji Alphabet, transforming your words into a fun, emoji-filled version!

We provide downloads of the Emoji Alphabet in various formats, including JSON, JavaScript, and plain text, as well as access to the all the files and the source code on GitHub. For inspiration, we've also prepared samples from literature and poetry that showcase the creative possibilities of the alphabet.

This is an ongoing, open project and we aim to establish an inclusive community, where all input is welcome. You can share suggestions, engage in discussions, and contribute to the project in any way possible.

## Selection and Design Principles

The selection of emoji for the Emoji Alphabet was guided by several key principles. First, if a letter was already included in an emoji, it was chosen. Then, if an emoji represented the letter directly or clearly resembled the letter’s shape, it was chosen. If more than one emoji resembpled a leeter, the emoji with the most distinct and recognizable shapes were prioritized to ensure clarity and ease of identification. The main goal was to pick emoji that had clear lines and a simple design, making them easy to distinguish, even at smaller sizes.

In cases where no emoji directly represented the letter or its shape, the next step was to find an object or symbol that could be associated with the letter. For example, for the letter "K," a key emoji was chosen due to the phonetic similarity between "key" and "K." This approach helps maintain a strong, logical connection between the letter and its corresponding emoji, making the alphabet intuitive.

Color also played a role in the selection process. A key goal was to have most of the emoji feature similar colors (primarily red, blue, and purple) to maintain a sense of consistency across the alphabet and create a visually cohesive system. We aimed for a design that feels unified while still allowing each emoji to stand out clearly from the others.

Another consideration was ensuring that the emoji selected were similar across all major vendors. Given that emoji can appear differently across platforms, it was important to choose symbols that were similarly designed by all major vendors. In this way, the alphabet will look consistent in most devices.

It’s important to note that the choices made for the Emoji Alphabet are not final. Contributors are encouraged to suggest changes or improvements, allowing the system to evolve and become even more refined. The Emoji Alphabet remains is always open to new ideas and insights!
